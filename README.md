* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude: Latitude has a slight negative correlation to humidity in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres.
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude: In the Southern hemisphere there is a slight negative correlation with cloudiness but there is no correlation in the Northern hemisphere.
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude: There is a very slight positive correlation between latitude and windspeed in the Northern hemisphere and a slight negative correlation between these two factors in the Southern hemisphere.
